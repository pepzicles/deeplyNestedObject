Page 1: Little insight into my own POV: 
When I first came to NYC, I remember everyone's shocked reactions when I revealed that caning was still a form of judicial punishment in Singapore. 
Born and raised in Singapore, I thought that this form of punishment was the same everywhere.
In fact, it's considered a "light punishment" as opposed to going to jail.
I was always taken aback by people's responses towards this fact, and I did not know how to respond.
Did this make Singapore a more "backward" country? 
Given the backdrop of how canes were used in American History, I can understand the fear and resentment of such form of corporal punishment.
However, I became intrigued by the differences in my, and everyone's perspective of caning, and started diving into a rabbit hole behind the significance and origins of Caning in Singapore.


Page 2: History
- Caning was first introduced to Malaya and Singapore during the period of British Colonial Rule in the 19th Century. 
- In that era, offences punishable by caning included robbery, theft, burglary, sexual assault/ abuse etc. 
- Caning remained on the statute book after Malaya became independent from the British in 1957.
- Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965.
- Subsequent legistlation has been passed by the parliament of Singapore to increase the min. strokes an offender receives and the number of crimes punished with caning. 

Page 3: Administrative procedues
- Caning is always ordered in addition to a jail sentence, and is not a punishment by itself.
- Those who are sentenced to caning and are in the process of appealing against their sentences do not have their sentences carried out while pending the outcome of their appeals.
- The offender is not told in advance when he will be caned; 
- He is notified only on the day his sentence is to be carried out. 
- Offenders often undergo a lot of psychological distress as a result of being put into such uncertainty.
- It is administered in an enclosed area in prison out of view of the public and other inmates. 

Page 4: How does the cane look like? 
- Rattan cane, no more than 0.5" in diameter
- Soaked in water overnight to prevent it from splitting and embedding splinters in wounds
- A lighter cane is used for juvinile offenders
- offenders would have to strip completely naked for the caning and has to bend over 90 degrees for the caning. The British Dual-purpose prison flogging frame is still used today. 


Page 5: Diplomatic Crisis
- Michael P. Fay, an 18-year-old American citizen convicted of vandalism in March 1994 and sentenced to four months' imprisonment, a S$3,500 fine, and six strokes of the cane. 
- This incident attracted worldwide publicity and sparked a minor diplomatic crisis between Singapore and the United States. 
- Despite an appeal for clemency from U.S. President Bill Clinton to commute the caning sentence, Singapore's President Ong Teng Cheong refused to pardon Fay, but nonetheless reduced Fay's caning sentence from six to four strokes out of consideration for the long years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and the US. 
- Fay was caned on 5 May 1994 in Queenstown Remand Prison.


Page 6: What countries still use caning today? 
In some countries caning is still in use in the post-independence era, particularly in Southeast Asia (where it is now being used far more than it was under British rule)
and in some African countries. The practice is retained, for male offenders only, under the criminal law in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.


Page 7 : My POV + Food for thought. 
- I am conflicted in my thoughts and feelings about this. 
- One one hand, I think that it is a very undignified and violent way to treat someone, and that caning should be removed as a corporal punishment
- on the other hand, I am angry at the fact that this was introduced during the Colonial rule. 
- While I understand that the current SG government should perhaps review the necessity and the implications of caning, I am also critical about the fact that I am coming from a very western-influenced lens.
- I am frustrated at the fact that, because of this, people would view Singapore as a "backward" nation that has not "kept up with the times". And that the government is "brutal" or "inhumane"
- However, we didn't get to choose what was implemented in law in the first place. 
- Am also tired of people demanding these countries to follow what is seen as "right".
- Post-colonial effects are still very much present, and this is just one of the many signs of it.
